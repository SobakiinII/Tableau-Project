# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals

The tasks were given as follows:
# Tasks:
Use Tableau to answer the following questions and deliver results using a 5-minute PowerPoint or PDF presentation. All questions should be answered using the right visualizations:

- Show the trend of house prices across Canada in the last 40 years (table housing_price_index).
- Compare the trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices in table real_estate_prices to see if there are any differences.
- Compare this trend with the trend of office prices. Which one is getting more expensive, faster?
- Create a heatmap of Canada with current house prices for each available district.
- Are the price differences between different districts increasing?
- Compare the trend of house prices with earnings. *In case you want to plot monthly salary, be aware that the earnings value is per week.
- Did people spend more of their earnings in 2014 than they did in 2001?
- There were several economic crises in the world in the last 40 years, including these four: Black Monday (1987), Recession (early 1990s), dot com bubble (2000 - 2002), Financial crisis (2007 - 2009). Show the effect of these crises on:
  - Earnings
  - House prices
  - Office prices
  - House constructions
  - Consumer index
- Plot consumer_index together with housing_price_index and fit the regression line between them. Can we predict consumer_index from the housing_price_index?
- Try to find an interesting pattern, trend, outlier, etc. from the data used in the above questions.
  - HINT : Double check all units in the table before any comparison.

# Goals:

My goals with this project are simply to use Tableau to properly visualize and analyze the given datasets 

## Process
### Visualizing the trend of house prices
Using Tableau, I graphed the average price of a house by the year
it was measured. First I had to apply a calculation on the dat column, as 
its data was formated as a string. Once it was a date and the line plot
was finished, I could use a trend line to track the increase in housing prices.
### (your step 2)

## Results
I chose Option 1.

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
